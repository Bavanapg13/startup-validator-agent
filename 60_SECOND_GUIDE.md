## ⏱️ 60-Second Quick Start

### **Minute 0: Get API Key** (offline)
Visit: https://console.groq.com
- Sign up (free)
- Create API key
- Copy it (looks like: `gsk_abc123...`)

### **Minute 1: Create .env File**
In your project folder, create a file named `.env` with:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here
```

### **Minute 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Minute 3: Run Agent**
```bash
python main.py
```

### **Minute 4-5: Enter Your Idea**
When prompted, describe your startup:
```
Example: "A mobile app that uses AI to help restaurants
reduce food waste by predicting demand and suggesting menu changes."
```

### **Minutes 6-7: Wait for Analysis**
Agent analyzes across all 6 steps (30-60 seconds)

### **Minutes 8-15: Review Your 6-Step Analysis**
```
Step 1: Feasibility → Can it be built?
Step 2: Market → Is there demand?
Step 3: Risks → What could go wrong?
Step 4: MVP → What should we build?
Step 5: Roadmap → How to build it?
Step 6: Timeline → When to build what?
```

**Done!** ✅ You have your complete startup analysis.

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

**Provide a detailed idea:**
```
❌ Bad: "A productivity app"
✅ Good: "A Slack plugin that automatically categorizes 
   messages by priority and summarizes daily emails 
   for busy managers"
```

**Include these details:**
1. **Problem** - What pain point are you solving?
2. **Solution** - How does your product solve it?
3. **Users** - Who specifically will use this?
4. **Differentiation** - Why is this better?
5. **Constraints** - Team size, budget, timeline

**Example to copy:**
```
PROBLEM: Freelance designers waste 10+ hours/week on 
client communication and project management.

SOLUTION: AI-powered project management tool specifically 
for design teams, integrated with Figma and Slack, with 
automatic progress tracking and client updates.

TARGET USERS: Freelance design studios (2-5 people) earning 
$50K-500K annually, using Figma professionally.

DIFFERENTIATION: Built specifically for designers 
(vs generic PM tools), auto-syncs with design files, 
generates client updates automatically.

CONSTRAINTS: $20K startup budget, 2 co-founders 
(1 designer, 1 developer), 12-week runway.
```
