## 📊 The 6-Step Analysis Framework

Every startup idea goes through:

```
Step 1: Feasibility Analysis
├─ Technical complexity
├─ Time to MVP
├─ Budget estimate
├─ Team requirements
└─ YES/NO verdict

Step 2: Market Analysis
├─ Target users
├─ Market size (TAM)
├─ Demand signals
├─ Competition
└─ Differentiation

Step 3: Risk Identification
├─ Technical risks (with severity)
├─ Market risks (with severity)
├─ Execution risks
├─ Financial risks
├─ Regulatory risks
└─ Mitigation for each

Step 4: Idea Improvement & MVP
├─ Features to remove
├─ Core hypothesis
├─ 3-5 MVP features
└─ Out-of-scope items

Step 5: MVP Roadmap
├─ Phase 1 (weeks 1-3)
├─ Phase 2 (weeks 4-6)
├─ Phase 3 (weeks 7-9)
└─ Phase 4+ (launch)

Step 6: Execution Timeline
├─ Week 1-12 breakdown
├─ Specific tasks per week
